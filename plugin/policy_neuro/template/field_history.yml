  history_len: 50              # Int, the length of the history buffer
  newest_first: true           # [Optional] Bool, whether the newest entry is at the beginning (true) or the end (false)
  include_current_frame: true  # [Optional] Bool, whether to include current frame in output

                               #   If null or not provided, the default value will be the first frame of the source field when the history is initialized.
                               #   If a single float is provided, it will be broadcasted to all dimensions of the source field.
                               #   If a list of floats is provided, its length must match the dimension of the source field, and it will be used as the default value.
